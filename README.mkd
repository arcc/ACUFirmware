ARXTalk
=======

Firmware for the LoFASM ARX Control Unit (ACU). Depends on CmdMessenger and
Streaming libraries.

Does require a modified version of the CmdMessenger library, which is included
here. Modifications are being submitted to the author, and may eventually become
part of the upstream repo.
